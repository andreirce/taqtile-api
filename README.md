# DevTile

I chose the name DevTile because "Tile" is inspired by Taqtile and the "Dev" stands for development, representing the challenge on creating user registration systems. This name reflects both the technical aspect of the project and its connection to Taqtile, emphasizing innovation and structure in the development process.

# Description
