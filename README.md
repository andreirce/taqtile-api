# DevTile 📙

I chose the name DevTile because "Tile" is inspired by Taqtile and the "Dev" stands for development, representing the challenge on creating user registration systems. This name reflects both the technical aspect of the project and its connection to Taqtile, emphasizing innovation and structure in the development process.

# Description 📝

DevTile is a user management project designed as a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) system, providing essential functionality for handling user data. Built with scalability in mind, DevTile allows for efficient user registration, updates, retrieval, and deletion of user information.
